##R specific function typeof returns the type of an R object##

##The following table describes the possible values returned by typeof and what they are##
"NULL"              NULL
"symbol"            a variable name
"pairlist"          a pairlist object (mainly internal)
"closure"           a function
"environment"       an environment
"promise"           an object used to implement lazy evaluation
"language"          an R language construct
"special"           an internal function that does not evaluate its arguments
"builtin"           an internal function that evaluates its arguments
"char"              a ‘scalar’ string object (internal only) ***
"logical"           a vector containing logical values
"integer"           a vector containing integer values
"double"            a vector containing real values
"complex"           a vector containing complex values
"character"         a vector containing character values
"..."               the special variable length argument ***
"any"               a special type that matches all types: there are no objects of this type
"expression"        an expression object
"list"              a list
"bytecode"          byte code (internal only) ***
"externalptr"       an external pointer object
"weakref"           a weak reference object
"raw"               a vector containing bytes
"S4"                an S4 object which is not a simple object

Users cannot easily get hold of objects of types marked with a ‘***’.

##Vectors###
Vectors can be thought of as contiguous cells containing data. Cells are accessed through
indexing operations such as x[5].

R has six basic (‘atomic’) vector types. The modes and stoarage modes for the different
vectpr types are listed in the following table 

typeof       mode         storage.mode
logical      logical      logical
integer      numeric      integer
double       numeric      double
complex      complex      complex
character    character    character
raw          raw          raw
